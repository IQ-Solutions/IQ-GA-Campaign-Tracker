# IQ-GA-Campaign-Tracker
JavaScript file that can track external links into Google Analytics campaign

This JavaScript tracks external links on a Drupal site into a Google Analytics campaign. Provided the website has the Google Analytics tag installed, all you need to do in this file is insert the client's GA tracking ID, the external link or links you wish to track and your campaign Medium and Name. Instructional comments are provided next to specific lines of code. This script is written for Drupal 7 sites but can be modified for Drupal 8 or a jQuery file. This uses Google Analytics Field References to track the click event into the campaign. See reference here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference
